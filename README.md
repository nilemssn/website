# Nile MSSN Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7f7278a8-4088-4a40-92f7-499a906cecf0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nilemssn/deploys)

(Cloned from [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone this repository.**

    Run the following command in your terminal to get a local copy of this repository.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/nilemssn/website.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    Navigate into the repository and install its dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd website/ && npm install
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Start up the development server.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site should now be running at http://localhost:8000. Open the repository in your code editor and start editing the files. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser) such as the site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

2.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

3.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

4.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about the site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

7.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

8.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

9.  **`package-lock.json`** This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

10. **`README.md`**: This file :smile:! It's a text file containing useful reference information about this project.
